In designing the interactive visualization for the energy dataset, I aimed to create a clear, intuitive, 
and informative visual representation of the data. We chose to use bubble charts because they effectively 
communicate the relative magnitudes of different categories through the size of the bubbles, making it easy 
for users to compare values at a glance. The use of color to encode the values of the selected category further 
enhances this comparison. We opted for a linear color scale transitioning from purple to green
to visually distinguish low and high values effectively. To enhance readability and usability, I included 
interactive elements such as sliders and dropdown menus, allowing users to filter data by year, population, 
energy category, and data type. These interaction techniques make the visualization dynamic and adaptable to 
the user's needs, providing a more engaging and informative experience. Alternatives considered included bar 
charts and line graphs; however, these were less effective in presenting the relative magnitude and clustering 
information that bubble charts can convey succinctly.


Developing this visualization as a solo endeavor involved a comprehensive , encompassing data exploration, customization, 
and implementation. Initially, the process required extensive data exploration to understand the structure and intricacies 
of the energy dataset. This step was crucial for identifying key attributes, filtering relevant data points, and ensuring 
accurate representations. Transitioning from data exploration to visualization design, I encountered significant challenges 
in balancing the complexity of the data with the need for an intuitive user interface. Customizing the visualization involved 
extensive trial and error, particularly in adjusting the D3.js configurations to achieve the desired interactive features and 
aesthetic appeal. The most time-consuming aspect was refining the interactivity, ensuring that the sliders and dropdowns worked
seamlessly together to update the visualization in real-time. This required meticulous debugging and iterative testing to resolve 
issues and enhance the user experience.

Overall, the project took approximately 40 hours to develop, with the bulk of the time dedicated to fine-tuning the interactive 
elements and ensuring data accuracy. Working solo meant that every aspect of the project, from data processing and D3.js 
implementation to styling and UI design, had to be handled independently. This provided a comprehensive learning experience but 
also highlighted the challenges of managing a complex project without the benefit of team collaboration. Despite these challenges, 
the decision to structure the visualization this way ensures clarity and ease of use. T
